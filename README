PyQt5-builder - The PEP 517 Compliant PyQt5 Build System
========================================================

What is PyQt5-builder?
----------------------

PyQt5-builder is the PEP 517 compliant build system for PyQt5 and projects that
extend PyQt5.  It extends the sip5 build system and uses Qt's ``qmake`` to
perform the actual compilation and installation of extension modules.

Projects that use PyQt5-builder provide an appropriate ``pyproject.toml`` file
and an optional ``project.py`` script.  Any PEP 517 compliant frontend, for
example ``sip5-install`` or ``pip`` can then be used to build and install the
project.
