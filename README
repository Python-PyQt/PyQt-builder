PyQt-builder - The PEP 517 Compliant PyQt Build System
======================================================

What is PyQt-builder?
---------------------

PyQt-builder is the PEP 517 compliant build system for PyQt and projects that
extend PyQt.  It extends the SIP build system and uses Qt's ``qmake`` to
perform the actual compilation and installation of extension modules.

Projects that use PyQt-builder provide an appropriate ``pyproject.toml`` file
and an optional ``project.py`` script.  Any PEP 517 compliant frontend, for
example ``sip-install`` or ``pip`` can then be used to build and install the
project.
